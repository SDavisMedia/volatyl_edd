/** Template Name: Custom Layout
 *
 ***** THIS IS A CORE VOLATYL FILE AND SHOULD NOT BE EDITED!
 ***** ALL CUSTOM CODING SHOULD BE DONE IN A CHILD THEME.
 ***** MORE INFORMATION - http://volatylthemes.com/why-child-themes/
 *******************************************************************
 *
 * The purpose of this template is to provide a blank canvas for you
 * to build a custom layout. It calls to the volatyl() function just
 * like every other template.; that way you can grab the header, footer,
 * and other elements that don't change from page to page.
 *
 * After that, the main content area will face a conditional that checks
 * to see what kind of template is being served. If it's this custom 
 * template, no default content will display. Instead, you'll be able to
 * create your own custom layout... hence the name of this file.
 *
 * You'll use the *main_content_custom_layout()* hook to add content.
 * Use the functions.php file in your CHILD THEME to do so! 
 *
 * @package Volatyl
 * @since Volatyl 1.0
