Q. Do I have to have an activated license key to use Volatyl?

A. Nope. It'll work just fine without a license key. However, you will not receive dashboard updates or support unless you have a valid license key. If you do not have a license key and you would like one (I love your integrity), please visit the pricing page. http://volatylthemes.com/pricing/

Q. Can I use Volatyl for EDD without using EDD?

A. Sure! Volatyl for EDD does not require that EDD be activated. This is an ideal setup if you intend to have a digital store in the future but you're not ready for it just yet.
